# Pokemon Battle Simulator
A Scratch program that attempts to emulate a wild Pokémon battle from the original games.

This program is what I worked on in my down time between school Scratch projects. I got nowhere close to completing this project, as such, only the Run function works properly.

Scratch is required to run this program.
